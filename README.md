# 4-Channel OGX360 with USB Hub
External Wireless Controller mod for the Original Xbox (4 controller version with USB Hub)

## Intro
This project builds on the hard work done by Ryzee119.  https://github.com/Ryzee119/ogx360
Please consider donating to him here because without him, I wouldn't have been able to produce this item:

This variation of the OGX360 adds a 4-port USB Hub to the main PCB.  Having a built-in USB Hub allows you to plug in four different USB devices (such as a wired Hyperkin Duke controller, 8bitdo Bluetooth receiver, Xbox 360 wireless receiver, or any combination of different USB device types).

### * WARNING *
This project is in the BETA STAGE.  A previous version of the PCB was tested and everything worked great but it has not gone through rigorous testing with four players bashing buttons for hours.  (LOL!)  Use at your own risk!
